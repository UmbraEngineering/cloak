# cloak

A Client-Side JavaScript MVC Framework

## What is cloak?

Cloak is [eventemitter2](https://github.com/hij1nx/EventEmitter2) + [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) + [lodash](http://lodash.com/) + [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) + [classes](https://github.com/kbjr/class.js) + MVC goodness, all packaged together into a tight-knit, well functioning framework with very little learning curve.

## Where is the documentation?

Cloak is a fairly new framework, and I haven't gotten around to writing up full documentation yet.
