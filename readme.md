_Version 0.2.2-dev_

A Client-Side JavaScript MVC Framework

## What is cloak?

Cloak.js is a client-side MVC web application framework. Inspired greatly by <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone.js</a>,
Cloak.js has many similar features and should be very easy to learn for anyone familiar with Backbone.js.

Cloak.js is still be developed and improved. The following are features that are still to be added before the v1.0 release.

* Integration with Cloak's sister project Dagger.js - A Node.js API server framework - with seemless socket communication between Cloak's models and your data on the server with Dagger available out of the box.
* Cleaned up and generally improved `Collection` class.
* More complete schema support for `Model`.
* More complete `Router` class with "controller" like structure.
